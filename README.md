This is code used to create a glowing effect using a microcontroller and green filament LEDs in a prop syringe filled with green liquid.
There are three effects: static, breathing, and flicker.
A single latching push button is used to both turn the microcontroller on and off and switch effects.
The microcontroller remembers the last effect used and switches to the next effect when it is powered on.
